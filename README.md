# Project_web_shop

At the end of the course at Software Development Academy, together with the group, I completed a final project which took about 15 hours. It concerned testing the store's website (http://automationpractice.com/index.php)

3 groups were formed (I was in the 2nd group)

1) We started the project by evaluating the test documentation and reporting its errors.
2) Then we created test cases based only on the test documentation. (We haven't got the link to the store page yet)
3) Then we made our own test cases on web site. When the error appeared, we reported it.
4) Finally, we performed exploratory tests of those website functionalities that were not included in the test documentation.
